        /// ## Usage
        ///
        /// ```swift
        /// let result = try Kernel.IO.Completion.Port.write(handle, from: buffer, overlapped: &overlapped)
        /// switch result {
        /// case .pending:
        ///     // Wait for completion via port
        ///     let entry = try Kernel.IO.Completion.Port.Dequeue.single(port, timeout: INFINITE)
        ///     let count = entry.0
        /// case .completed(let bytes):
        ///     // Completed immediately, no port notification
        ///     print("Wrote \(bytes) bytes synchronously")
        /// }
        /// ```
