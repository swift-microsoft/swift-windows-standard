        ///
        /// ```swift
        /// // Single completion
        /// let item = try Kernel.IO.Completion.Port.Dequeue.single(port, timeout: INFINITE)
        /// switch item.status {
        /// case .ok:
        ///     // I/O completed successfully
        ///     print("Transferred \(item.bytes) bytes")
        /// case .platform(let code):
        ///     // I/O failed but was dequeued
        ///     print("Operation failed: \(code)")
        /// }
        ///
        /// // Batch completion (more efficient)
        /// var entries = [OVERLAPPED_ENTRY](repeating: .init(), count: 64)
        /// let count = try entries.withUnsafeMutableBufferPointer { buffer in
        ///     try Kernel.IO.Completion.Port.Dequeue.batch(port, entries: buffer, timeout: 100)
        /// }
        /// ```
